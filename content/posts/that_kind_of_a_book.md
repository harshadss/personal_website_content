I've often had this experience: certain technical topics look extremely
difficult to break into. No matter how many standard resources and popular
content that you read through, every one of them seems to speak a foreign
language. I've felt this while studying topics like complex numbers, Fourier's
transform, relativity, to name a few.

I am of the opinion that either I'm too dumb or writers of many popular
expositions on such topics have not understood it clearly. And I secretly like
to think later is the case. The authors never seem to be running into some
questions that immediately come to mind while studying: for example, asking
why are we doing this? But then there are some resources that are godsend.
The author runs into exact same questions that I mentioned above and, gasps,
tries to answer them.

Tristan Needham's work Visual Complex Analysis falls into such group. In about
65 pages of chapter 1, he explains complex numbers in a beautiful and simple
language. He also sets out to give you big picture view. For example, he gives
a quick tour of geometry via group theory lens and even talks about quaternions.

I simply have lot of respect for such authors. They just decide that some topic
can be explained in a plain language and few pictures. And then they also make
the hard work to pull it off. Simply beautiful stuff!
